# CS305

Artemis Financial is a service that provides their customers various financial services and the best security for sensitive user data. With security as a main focus Global Rain was tasked to provide written code that would boost their security profile and give hackers less of a chance to attack and exploit their customers data. This will eventually gain the trust of customers and eventually attract more customers in the long term. Implementing an SSL certificate and HTTP port are the best practices going forward when beefing up security. 

My strategy for implementing extra layers of security would be filtering out false positives and running depending checks to identify which vulnerabilites to suppress. When you refactor you have to rerun the dependency check to find any new vulnerabilites after the fact.  One of the most effective resources would be running the dependency plugin to effectively indentify security vulnerabilities. This includes testing multiple times to make sure you these vulnerabilites are suppressed and secure.
